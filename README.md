Jiayi is written in C# and uses HTML for the UI via Blazor Hybrid.

The code is admittedly a mess, hence why there is no code style to adhere to. However, please try to keep the code clean and readable. There will be a code style guide in the future.

A quick rundown for those who don't want to read all that:
- You can modify, share and sell the code any way you please
- but you have to open source projects that do this under a compatible GPL license
